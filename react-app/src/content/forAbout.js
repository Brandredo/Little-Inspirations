    title: "About Jenny",
    body: "My name is Jennifer Figueredo. I am the owner and directory of Little Inspirations. I have a Bachelor's degree in Early Education from Salem State University. After graduating from Salem State in 1989, I worked in a center-based childcare program where I was approached by a family for a nanny position. Later I decided to get licensed and became a family childcare provider in 1992. In 1996 I became a mother of identical twin boys. I have been in operation for thirty years, and am now caring for the children of the kids I used to care for. I'm lucky enough to work with a wonderful teaching assistant who I started caring for at just eleven months. Watching children grow, helping them to learn, create, problem solve, and have fun has been a blessing and true calling for me. The chilren who have touched my life are truly inspirations to me. In my free time I enjoy camping and hiking, and I also love to walk my two chocolate labs with my family."
